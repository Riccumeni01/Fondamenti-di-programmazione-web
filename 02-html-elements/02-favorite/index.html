    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>A programming <strong>language</strong> is a system of notation for writing <strong>computer programs</strong>.</p>
    <h2>C</h2>
    <p>C (pronounced like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. </p>
    <p>By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[7] for application software. 
    <p>C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, class-based, <em>object-oriented programming language</em> that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
    <p>It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
    <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.</p>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.</p>
    <p>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
